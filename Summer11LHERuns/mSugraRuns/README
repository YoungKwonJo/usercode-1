This directory contains text files with a listing of SLHA files that
produce good or bad models.  The bad models have a charged particle
that is interpreted as stable by Pythia.  In one case, this is because
the stop has a negative width (likely a SUSYHITS bug). In all others,
it is because SoftSusy produced a lightest Susy particle that is charged
(unclear why this was not flagger earlier).

The files badModelNames_tanb_A0_signMu.txt show  (modelFile, KF code of bad particle)
The files goodModelNames_tanb_A0_signMu.txt show (modelFile, LO cross section)

As usual, the LO cross from Pythia is in (mb), so that 1E-09 mb = 1 pb.
